# Restaurant Reviews App

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. A static design that lacks accessibility needs to be converted into responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker is required to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## Run the Application

In order to run the application:

Run it localy

- Download as .zip file or clone this project:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/stearruda/fend-restaurant-reviews-app.git
  ```

- In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

- In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

- With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
